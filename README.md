# APP_ModbusCommunications

It is a simulator of modbus communications that you have the server and client app, and you can simulate the modbus request.

## What is modbus?

It is an industrial communication protocol, Modbus, which uses TCP/IP transport and network protocols to control and manage one or more PLCs through an Ethernet or Internet network. The approach is based on a master–slave philosophy, where the master is typically a PC, PLC, or operator panel, and the slave is a PLC.
